# Fitting Package README

## Introduction

The `Fitting` package provides tools and utilities for curve fitting and analysis of DICOM medical imaging data, specifically focusing on T2* relaxation times. T2* relaxation is a crucial parameter in MRI that can provide valuable information about tissues and their environment. The package offers functionality to fit T2* relaxation times to mono-exponential models, read DICOM data, and process the fitting results.
