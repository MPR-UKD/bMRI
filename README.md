**Still in progress**

# bMRI

bMRI is an open-source framework designed for the analysis of bio-sensitive MRI data. The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive, flexible and easy-to-use tool for researchers and professionals working with MRI data. **The project is currently still in progress** and is completely written in Python. 

The framework is focused on leveraging the power of Python's scientific computing stack to process and analyze MRI data. It uses widely adopted libraries such as NumPy and SciPy to ensure efficiency and interoperability with other Python tools.

## Code Structure

The codebase is structured around a few key components:

1. The `Fitting` package: This package provides tools and utilities for curve fitting and the analysis of DICOM medical imaging data, specifically focusing on T2*, T2, T1rho and T1 relaxation times.
2. The `Utilitis` package: This package provides some support function for reading and writing.
3. The `Visualisation` package: THhs package provides the ImageViewer Class, which enables the visualisation of data and results (see below).

## Installation and Requirements

You can install all requirements with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 

## Example Code and Usage
